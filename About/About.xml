Just a simple patch-mod that sets all vanilla traits to commonality 0. 

For players that want to only use modded traits.

Defs are still there as there are some backstories that forces some traits.

--- NOTICE ---
Will give errors that commonality is set to 0 if Develpoment mode is active, this can be ignored.
Game will not load map if there are no added traits loaded as it will not be able to generate pawns.
